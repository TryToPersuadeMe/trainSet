Introduction</h6>        <p class="paragraph__text">          Random Forest is a flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces, even without hyper-parameter tuning,          a great result most of the time. It can be used for both <span class="paragraph__text_bold">classification</span> and          <span class="paragraph__text_bold">regression</span> tasks. In this article, you are going to learn how the random          forest algorithm deals with classification and regression problems.        </p>        <p class="paragraph__text paragraph__text_blue paragraph__text_italic">          To understand the Random Forest algorithm, you have to be familiar with Decision Trees at first. Read an article on          Decision Trees <a href="https://ml-book.com/docs/cl_dt_id3/" class="paragraph__text_link">here</a>.        </p>        <p class="paragraph__text">          One of the common problems with decision trees, especially the ones that have a table full of columns, is that they tend          to over fit a lot. Sometimes it looks like the tree just <span class="paragraph__text_blue">memorizes</span> the data.          Here are the typical examples of decision trees that overfit, both for categorical and continuous data:        </p>        <ul class="paragraph__text paragraph__list paragraph__list_dots-type">          <li>            Categorical:<span class="paragraph__text_blue">              If the client is male, between 15 and 25, from the US, likes ice-cream, has a German friend, hates birds and ate              pancakes on August 25th, 2012, - he is likely to download Pokemon Go.</span            >          </li>          <li class="nestedPicture paragraph__list_nestedPicture">            <span>Continuous</span>            <div class="nestedPicture__image"><picture><source srcset="./resources/images/academy/1.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="./resources/images/academy/1.png" alt="#" /></picture></div>          </li>        </ul>        <p class="paragraph__text">where t is the upper bound for the sum of the coefficients.</p>        <p class="paragraph__text">          Random Forest prevents this problem: it is an ensemble of multiple decision trees, not just one. And the more the number          of these decision trees in Random Forest, the better the generalization.        </p>        <p class="paragraph__text">More precisely, Random Forest works as follows:</p>        <ol class="paragraph__list paragraph__list_bold-marker paragraph__text">          <li>            Selects k features (columns) from the dataset (table) with a total of m features randomly (where ). Then, it builds a            Decision Tree from those k features.          </li>          <li>            Repeats n times so that you have n Decision Trees built from different random combinations of k features (or a            different random sample of the data, called bootstrap sample).          </li>          <li>            Takes each of the n built Decision Trees and passes a random variable to predict the outcome. Stores the predicted            outcome (target), so that you have a total of n outcomes from the n Decision Trees.          </li>          <li>            Calculates the votes for each predicted target and takes the mode (most frequent target variable). In other words,            considers the high voted predicted target as the final prediction from the random forest algorithm.          </li>        </ol>        <p class="paragraph__text paragraph__text_blue paragraph__text_italic">          *In case of a regression problem, for a new record, each tree in the forest predicts a value for Y (output). The final          value can be calculated by taking the average of all the values predicted by all the trees in a forest. Or, in case of a          classification problem, each tree in the forest predicts the category to which the new record belongs. Finally, the new          record is assigned to the category that wins the majority vote.        </p>        <p class="paragraph__text">          <span class="paragraph__text_bold"> Example:</span> James wants to decide what places he should visit during his one          week stay in Paris. He goes to a friend who lived there one year and asks what he visited in the past and if he liked it          or not. Based on his experience, he will give James some advice.        </p>        <p class="paragraph__text">          This is a typical decision tree algorithm approach. James’ friend decided about what James should visit, based on his          personal experience of a year.        </p>        <p class="paragraph__text">          Later, James starts asking more and more of his friends to advise him, and they recommend the places they have been to.          Then James chooses the places that were recommend the most to him, which is the typical Random Forest algorithm          approach.        </p>        <p class="paragraph__text paragraph__text_bold">          Thus, Random Forest is an algorithm that builds n decision trees by randomly selecting k out of the total of m features          for every decision tree, and takes the mode (average, if regression) of the predicted outcomes.        </p>      </div>      <div class="paragraph cardSection__paragraph">        <h6 class="paragraph__title paragraph__title_BG">2.

In general, a higher number of trees increases the performance and            makes the predictions more stable, but it also slows down the computation.          </li>          <li>            <span class="paragraph__text_bold">max_features:</span> the maximum number of features Random Forest is allowed to try            in an individual tree.
